description: I am a curious, methodical and creative graduate in Pharmaceutical Chemistry and Technology. Thanks to the international contexts I have been able to be a part of during my academic career, I learned the importance of communicating, listening and interacting in a clear, constructive and proactive way, as well as approaching difficult situations by adopting alternative perspectives and paying attention to details yet focusing on the bigger picture.
